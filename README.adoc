== Introduction

The Swarm plugin enables nodes to join a nearby Jenkins controller, thereby forming an ad-hoc cluster.
This plugin makes it easier to scale a Jenkins cluster by spinning up and tearing down new agents, enabling team members to contribute compute resources to a build farm or to attach agents to which the Jenkins controller cannot initiate connections.

This plugin consists of two pieces:

. A self-contained client that can join an existing Jenkins controller.
. A plugin that needs to be installed on the Jenkins controller to accept Swarm clients.

With the Swarm client, a person who is willing to contribute some of his computing power to the cluster just needs to run a virtual machine with the Swarm client and the cluster gets an additional agent.
Because the Swarm client is running on a separate VM, there is no need to worry about the builds/tests interfering with the host system or altering its settings unexpectedly.

== Getting started

. Install the Swarm plugin from the Update Center.
. Ensure your agent is running version 8 or later of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). The recommendation is to use the same JRE distribution and version as the controller.
. Download the Swarm client from `${JENKINS_URL}/swarm/swarm-client.jar` or https://repo.jenkins-ci.org/releases/org/jenkins-ci/plugins/swarm-client/[Jenkins repository] on your agent.
. Run the Swarm client with `java -jar path/to/swarm-client.jar -url ${JENKINS_URL} -username ${USERNAME}` and one of the authentication options as described in xref:docs/security.adoc#authentication[the Global Security Configuration documentation]. There are no other required command-line options; run with the `-help` option to see the available options.

[cols="1,1",options="header"]
|===
|Name |Description
|`-config FILE` |YAML configuration file containing the options.
|`-deleteExistingClients` |Delete any existing agent with the same name. (default: false)
|`-description VAL` |Description to be put on the agent.
|`-disableClientsUniqueId` |Disable client's unique ID. (default: false)
|`-disableSslVerification` |Disable SSL verification in the HTTP client. (default: false)
|`-disableWorkDir` |Disable Remoting working directory support and run the agent in legacy mode. (default: false)
|`-e (--env)` |An environment variable to be defined on this agent. It is specified as `key=value'. Multiple variables are allowed.
|`-executors N` |Number of executors (default: number of CPUs)
|`-failIfWorkDirIsMissing` |Fail if the requested Remoting working directory or internal directory is missing. (default: false)
|`-fsroot FILE` |Remote root directory. (default: .)
|`-help (--help, -h)` |Show the help screen (default: false)
|`-internalDir FILE` |The name of the directory within the Remoting working directory where files internal to Remoting will be stored.
|`-jar-cache FILE` |Cache directory that stores JAR files sent from the controller.
|`-keepDisconnectedClients` |Do not remove clients from the controller when the agent becomes disconnected. (default: false)
|`-labels VAL` |Whitespace-separated list of labels to be assigned for this agent. Multiple options are allowed.
|`-labelsFile VAL` |File location with space delimited list of labels. If the file changes, the client is restarted.
|`-maxRetryInterval N` |Max time to wait before retry in seconds. Default is 60 seconds. (default: 60)
|`-mode MODE` |The mode controlling how Jenkins allocates jobs to agents. Can be either `normal' (use this node as much as possible) or `exclusive' (only build jobs with label expressions matching this node). Default is `normal'. (default: normal)
|`-name VAL` |Name of the agent.
|`-noRetryAfterConnected` |Do not retry if a successful connection gets closed. (default: false)
|`-password VAL` |The Jenkins user API token or password.
|`-passwordEnvVariable VAL` |Environment variable containing the Jenkins user API token or password.
|`-passwordFile VAL` |File containing the Jenkins user API token or password.
|`-pidFile VAL` |File to write PID to. The client will refuse to start if this file exists and the previous process is still running.
|`-prometheusPort N` |If defined, then start an HTTP service on this port for Prometheus metrics. (default: -1)
|`-retry N` |Number of retries before giving up. Unlimited if not specified. (default: -1)
|`-retryBackOffStrategy RETRY_BACK_OFF_STRATEGY` |The mode controlling retry wait time. Can be either `none' (use same interval between retries) or `linear' (increase wait time before each retry up to maxRetryInterval) or `exponential' (double wait interval on each retry up to maxRetryInterval). Default is `none'. (default: NONE)
|`-retryInterval N` |Time to wait before retry in seconds. Default is 10 seconds. (default: 10)
|`-sslFingerprints VAL` |Whitespace-separated list of accepted certificate fingerprints (SHA-256/Hex), otherwise system truststore will be used. No revocation, expiration or not yet valid check will be performed for custom fingerprints! Multiple options are allowed. (default: )
|`-t (--toolLocation)` |A tool location to be defined on this agent. It is specified as `toolName=location'.
|`-tunnel VAL` |Connect to the specified host and port, instead of connecting directly to Jenkins. Useful when connection to Jenkins needs to be tunneled. Can be also HOST: or :PORT, in which case the missing portion will be auto-configured like the default behavior
|`-url (-master) VAL` |The complete target Jenkins URL like `http://server:8080/jenkins/'.
|`-username VAL` |The Jenkins username for authentication.
|`-webSocket` |Connect using the WebSocket protocol. (default: false)
|`-webSocketHeader NAME=VALUE` |Additional WebSocket header to set, e.g. for authenticating with reverse proxies. To specify multiple headers, call this flag multiple times, one with each header.
|`-workDir FILE` |The Remoting working directory where the JAR cache and logs will be stored.
