This plugin enables nodes to auto-discover a nearby Jenkins master and
join it automatically, thereby forming an ad-hoc cluster. Swarm makes it
easier to auto-scale a Jenkins cluster by spinning up and tearing down
new nodes, since no manual intervention is required to make them join or
leave the cluster.

See [the Swarm Plugin page](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Swarm+Plugin)
on the Jenkins wiki for more information.
