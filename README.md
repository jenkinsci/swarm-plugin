The Swarm plugin enables nodes to join a nearby Jenkins master, thereby
forming an ad-hoc cluster. This plugin makes it easier to scale a Jenkins
cluster by spinning up and tearing down new nodes.

This plugin consists of two pieces:

 1. A self-contained client that can join an existing Jenkins master.
 2. A plugin that needs to be installed on Jenkins master to accept
    Swarm clients.

With the Swarm client, a person who is willing to contribute some of his
computing power to the cluster just needs to run a virtual machine with
the Swarm client and the cluster gets an additional agent. Because the
Swarm client is running on a separate VM, there is no need to worry
about the builds/tests interfering with the host system or altering its
settings unexpectedly.

## Usage

 1. Install the Swarm plugin from the Update Center.
 2. Download [the Swarm
    client](https://repo.jenkins-ci.org/releases/org/jenkins-ci/plugins/swarm-client/).
 3. Run the Swarm client with `java -jar path/to/swarm-client.jar`.
    There are no required command-line options; run with the `-help`
    option to see the available options.
